 andalucian_reformation.1_1_desc:0 "When we defeated the Christians under the Umayyads, we soon experience a golden age of peace and tolerance like never before. But when this time eventually came to an end with the Christian fighting back, all was seemingly lost--until now. A prominant imam from one of our domains has come to us with a new theological doctrine that would greatly aid us in combating this recent push back. He claims that through hard work and devotion to God, we can overcome these obstacles and build a true paradise on earth."

His fiery writings calls for Christians to look at their faith with a renewed and fervent vision--one where the only way the gospel of Christ will prevail against heathens and heretics alike is by doing away with our own idols, putting on a holy armor, and facing these enemies head on in a global Crusade. His works have exploded in popularity all over France and have even been translated and brought across the border to Spain by the renoun Leonese preacher Ambrose Castrita. Our subject have now begun calling for our administration to officially adopt his ideas as government policy, but much of the clergy warns they are dangerous and could cause a schism in the Church."
