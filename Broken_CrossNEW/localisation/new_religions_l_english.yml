As such, they call for the restructuring of the clergy and the purification of the Church from what they view as corrupt practices, such as iconography, the veneration of 'idols', and excessive clerical wealth. Most importantly, however, they fervently advocate the need for spiritual revival and calls its followers to join a global Crusade against the enemies of Christ. Additionally, being born during the proliferation of the printing press, they also highly encourage wide-spread literacy and the translation and discussion of Scripture."
